        <h2>Joe Carter Walk Off World Series Winning Home Run </h2>

        <p> Not a day goes by that Joe Carter isn’t asked about his <b><i>World Series-winning home run</i></b> back in 1993.

“Especially in Toronto,” Carter saus. “They’ll talk about it every day, which is kind of what you’d expect.”
        Despite baseball’s long history, the walkoff homer during Game 6 of the 1993 World Series remains one of only two home runs to clinch a championship, the Blue Jays’ second title in as many years. And while Carter playfully reminds that he did, in fact, hit more than one home run in his career, and jokes that three-run winner on Oct. 23, 1993 is his cross to bear, he remembers the night pitch-for-pitch, every step that he took.

“CBS gave me a tape that evening of every camera that was on that night so I saw it from 9 to 10 different angles,” he said.

The best angle, in his mind, was on the Blue Jays dugout. Pinch runner Alfredo Griffin thrusting his hands in the air in celebration as the ball dropped over the wall in left field. The bench erupting. The fans erupting. To Carter, that look at those around him was “priceless” and gave him more joy than the scenes of himself running the bases.

“The epitome (for) every athlete is to be able to come through for their team in those moments, when all eyes are on you,” he said.

Soon, Carter will have a new team to come through for. He and Roberto Alomar have partnered with Budweiser Canada to come out of retirement and play with an adult recreational league. It is up to baseball fans to recruit Carter and Alomar by making an offer on why they deserve to play with the former Jays, using the hashtag #BudHomeRunContest and following Budweiser Canada and tagging Blue Jays on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The winning submission, which will be selected based on creativity, originality, quality and showing how far a team would go to sign a Toronto baseball idol, will be announced on July 25. Submissions will be accepted until July 20.

Carter likens adding himself and Alomar to a rec league baseball team to adding Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan to a rec league basketball team, even though he’s now age “29 times two.”

“You’re team’s going to be pretty good, pretty stoked, pretty excited,” Carter predicted.

            As for who would be more valuable to their new team, he or Alomar, Carter gave himself the edge.</p>

        <p>The 1993 World Series was the 90th edition of Major League Baseball's championship series and the conclusion of the 1993 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff series, it pitted the defending champions and American League (AL) champion Toronto Blue Jays against the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. With Toronto ahead three games to two in the Series, but trailing Game 6 by a score of 6-5 with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, with runners on first and second base and a count of two balls and two strikes, Joe Carter hit a game-winning three-run home run to win Game 6 by a score of 8-6 and the series four-games-to-two for Toronto, its second consecutive championship (the first team to repeat as champions since the 1977–78 Yankees). This was only the second Series concluded by such a home run (the first was in the 1960 World Series on a Bill Mazeroski home run for the Pittsburgh Pirates), and the first such occasion where a come-from-behind walk-off home run won a World Series</p>
